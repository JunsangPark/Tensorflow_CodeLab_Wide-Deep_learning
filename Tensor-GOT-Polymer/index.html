             <a href="http://tensorflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow</a> is a an open source library for numerical computation, specializing in machine learning applications. In this codelab, you will learn how to install and run TensorFlow on a single machine, and will predict deaths on Game of Thrones data using the tutorial Wide+Deep Learning Network.</p>
      <h2>What are we going to be building?</h2>
      <p>
      This codelab presents wide+deep learning model execution taking into account Game of Thrones data for Death classification & prediction .
The aim of this Codelab is to dig into wide+deep neural network model  to combine the benefits of memorization+generalization models, in which wide model is directly relevant to features and deep model improves the diversity of recommended systems. 

	The wide+deep learning tutorial comes within census data so we have been working with an analogous dataset taking into consideration Game of Thrones .</p>
      <h2 class="checklist">What You&#39;ll Learn</h2>
      <p>
      In the next sections you will know  how the dataset works ,how to implement the wide+deep learning model  and finally some conclusions about the experimentation with the model, and more in detail . Besides and listed, you will learn how to:</p> 
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Familiarize yourself with Tensorflow  </li>
        <li>How to select features for the wide part: choose the sparse base columns and crossed columns you want to use.</li>
        <li>Select features for the deep part: choose the continuous columns, the embedding dimension for each categorical column, and the hidden layer sizes.</li>
        <li>How to design the Wide+Deep Learning TensorFlow model </li>
        <li>Put them all together in a Wide & Deep model (DNNLinearCombinedClassifier).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="checklist">What You&#39;ll Need</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer connected to the internet with Python2.7 installed </li>
        <li>The libraries sklearn, pandas , numpy installed </li>
        <li>A basic understanding of python and neural nets</li>
        <li>A fast computer running OS X or Linux</li>
        <li>A fair amount of time</li>
      </ul>
	    
          <h2 class="checklist">The Goal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To made a classification model </li>
        <li>Predict the next character death probability in Game of Thrones</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Note:</strong>  This codelab has quiet periods of downloading and training. During those times, it might be a fun idea to play with the <a href="http://playground.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow Playground to learn more about neural net design</a>

      <h2>The data powering the CodeLab</h2>
      <img src="1_Comic.png" alt="TensorFlow JohnSnow & Sam correlation"> 
      <p>
      The GoT dataset was compiled from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kaggle</a> dataset and transformed to offer more information using Game of Thrones wiki . 
      Before going into a deeper data analysis, we would like to offer a view about the power of search with Answer the public tool. Using this visualization about the main five W some questions could be underlined about game of Thrones using  the searches in US and UK 
      These visualization flashlights the public interest about Game of Thrones deaths related to Why,What,When and How. In most of the searches there comes an interest about why all characters die, in which book each character die or in which TV season as well as searches about video compilations . Also we might  find comparisons to Walking Death. In a first general approach, we can see that searches about Game of Thrones Deaths are related to which deaths are packaged in each book or season. 
      The question ‘how’ might offer us a more practical approach about  people searching for compilation of deaths, Youtube videos about it. </p>
      <img src="2_question-visualisation.gif" alt="The five 5`ws about searches in Game of Thrones">     
      <h2>Data analysis</h2>
      <p>
	During this 0 point  we will serve as company for Tensorflow Codelab based on Game of Thrones Data, in order to provide a Neural Network model to classify the probability of Death of Game of Thrones characters with wide+deep model .
There is some data theory we will dive in when implementing the model, but first we will dig a little bit in the data in order to know more about the behaviour of our dataset </p>
      <p>
You can download the data from the button below. The original dataset has been released in Kaggle and we have been filling the information in Game of Thrones wiki focusing on title, culture . </p>
      <p>
You can download the data here . Please, fill free to check the information and add your suggestion and or feedback 
   
In one first approach of the dataset we extract the following useful information about the dataset, wich we consider a significant first approach for finding correlations and relationships in between variables 
	NUMBER OF CHARACTERS :  1946
	MEDIAN OF  AGE : 27
	      CORRELATION BETWEEN Number of Death Relationships and Popularity : 0.663 </p>
