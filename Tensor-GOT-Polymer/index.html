      <img src="0_logo.png" alt="TensorFlow Game of Thrones"> 
             <a href="http://tensorflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow</a> is a an open source library for numerical computation, specializing in machine learning applications. In this codelab, you will learn how to install and run TensorFlow on a single machine, and will predict deaths on Game of Thrones data using the tutorial Wide+Deep Learning Network.</p>
      <h2>What are we going to be building?</h2>
      <p>
      This codelab presents wide+deep learning model execution taking into account Game of Thrones data for Death classification & prediction .
The aim of this Codelab is to dig into wide+deep neural network model  to combine the benefits of memorization+generalization models, in which wide model is directly relevant to features and deep model improves the diversity of recommended systems. 

	The wide+deep learning tutorial comes within census data so we have been working with an analogous dataset taking into consideration Game of Thrones .</p>
      <h2 class="checklist">What You&#39;ll Learn</h2>
      <p>
      In the next sections you will know  how the dataset works ,how to implement the wide+deep learning model  and finally some conclusions about the experimentation with the model, and more in detail . Besides and listed, you will learn how to:</p> 
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Familiarize yourself with Tensorflow  </li>
        <li>How to select features for the wide part: choose the sparse base columns and crossed columns you want to use.</li>
        <li>Select features for the deep part: choose the continuous columns, the embedding dimension for each categorical column, and the hidden layer sizes.</li>
        <li>How to design the Wide+Deep Learning TensorFlow model </li>
        <li>Put them all together in a Wide & Deep model (DNNLinearCombinedClassifier).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="checklist">What You&#39;ll Need</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer connected to the internet with Python2.7 installed </li>
        <li>The libraries sklearn, pandas , numpy installed </li>
        <li>A basic understanding of python and neural nets</li>
        <li>A fast computer running OS X or Linux</li>
        <li>A fair amount of time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="checklist">The Goal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To made a classification model </li>
        <li>Predict the next character death probability in Game of Thrones</li>
      </ul>
