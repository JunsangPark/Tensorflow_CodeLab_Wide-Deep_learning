# Tensorflow Codelab : dive into wide+deep learning 
Wide+Deep learning Neural Network Tensorflow
Data used : Game of thrones data set from kaggle

For running this codelab, you should have installed in your machine
--Python 2.7 or Python 3
      $ pip install python
--Sklearn
     $ pip insstall sklearn 
--Numpy 


This codelab has been updated in March 2017
Following upgrades :

0.Introduction
1. Visualization behind GoT dataset
2. Installing Tensorflow V.1
3. Codelab execution

You can actually read all the codelab without execute the code, although it is recommended for you to download and play with it. Take into account that chapter 1 only takes a first dig into the dataset with the objetive to know more about it and help distinguish in between continuous and categorical features. 

The code has been proved with Tensorflow v1. 

## CONFIGURATION
You should have configured before running the Codelab:
            # Python 
            $ sudo apt-get update
            $ sudo apt-get -y update
            $ python3 -V
            # Packages
To manage software packages for Python, you can type :
            $ pip3 install 'package_name'

## FAQ
1. Do I need to know a lot about Tensorflow for running into this codelab?
No, you should have a basic understanding of datascience, variable modeling and neural nets. The architecture is clearly defined
